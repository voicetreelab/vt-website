	- A sister project emerged, [AgentTree](https://github.com/manu354/agent-tree) , to address a problem I had been discussing on the Claude subreddit - [complexity spirals](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1lfwlt2/complexity_thresholds_and_claude_ego_spirals/|). 
	- AgentTree would recursively decompose large problems into subtasks, and run agents in parallel on each subtask. It showed promise, but I realised I needed visibility into the subagents, to steer them more by providing live feedback.


On top of this VoiceTree platform, so much is possible, we have so far focused on two awesome use cases:

The first, is an interface for software engineers to manage multiple coding agents.

The second, is improving agents themselves, through compressing and better representing their context with VoiceTree.  

- improves human problem solving and decision making ability
- AND does the same for LLMS, whilst decreasing input tokens by 60-90%

All with the same core technology, VoiceTree.
