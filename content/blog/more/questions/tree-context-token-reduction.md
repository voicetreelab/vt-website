## How much can tree-structured context reduce LLM token usage?

Tree-structured context can reduce LLM input tokens by **60-90%** while preserving meaning.

### Why Trees Work Better Than Flat Context

The tree representation allows for more efficient content representation by decreasing cognitive load. It provides a memory aid for high-level concepts and relationships rather than getting lost in detail.

Both humans and LLMs benefit:
- **Humans** get improved decision-making through externalized short-term memory
- **LLMs** get decreased input tokens using the same core technology

### The Optimization Problem

The system solves: `minimize(structure_length + meaning_loss + understandability_loss)`

This creates an abstracted view of content with:
- Minimal structural length
- Maximum meaning preservation
- Easy understanding at the current working level of abstraction

### Cognitive Alignment

VoiceTree nodes represent the items a human can hold in working memory (5-8 items based on Miller's Law). This cognitive alignment is why the compression works without losing important information.
