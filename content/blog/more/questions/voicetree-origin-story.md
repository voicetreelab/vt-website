## Why was VoiceTree built?

When AI agents started getting good, I dreamed: **What if I could just explain my work out loud and agents would do the implementation?**

### The Vision

- Focus on architecting and problem-solving
- Let coding agents do the painful, repetitive parts
- Track everything on a visual tree that externalizes problem-solving paths

### The Background

Working on Jira's performance team at Atlassian was an amazing experience - exceptional teammates to learn from and a lab to experiment in.

Not just with systems at scale, but with **how I work**. When AI agents started getting good, I started experimenting with multi-agent workflows.

### The Problem Discovered

Running multiple AI agents creates a new bottleneck: **managing the agents themselves**.

Each agent needs:
- Clear context about what to do
- Coordination with other agents
- Human review and guidance
- Progress tracking

### The Solution

VoiceTree provides:
- Voice input to externalize thinking fast
- Automatic tree construction to organize context
- Agent launching on any node
- Visual canvas to manage everything

The goal: maximize the leverage you get from AI agents by solving the context and coordination problem.
