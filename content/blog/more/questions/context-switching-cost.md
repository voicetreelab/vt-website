## How do I reduce context-switching cost when managing AI agents?

Context switching is expensive because your brain must reconstruct the full mental model of what you were working on.

### The Problem

When managing multiple AI agents:
- Each agent has its own context and progress state
- Switching between agents requires loading new context
- You lose time remembering "where was I?" for each agent
- Important details get lost between switches

### The Solution

A spatial tree structure preserves not just what you were thinking, but the **entire context and reasoning path**.

### How It Works

1. **Visual persistence** - Your thought tree stays visible on the canvas
2. **Spatial memory** - Position on the canvas triggers recall (like a memory palace)
3. **Hierarchy shows relationships** - Parent-child structure shows how ideas connect
4. **Agent status visible** - Each agent node shows current state and progress

### Instant Resume

Resuming work requires minimal cognitive load. The visual map instantly reconstructs your mental state by showing:
- What you were thinking about
- Why you were thinking about it (parent context)
- What the agent was doing
- What comes next (sibling and child nodes)
