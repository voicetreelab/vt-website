## What problem does VoiceTree solve?

We rely on limited working memory to juggle tasks, backtrack through decisions, and document work. This leads to:
- Wasted time reconstructing context
- Context switching fatigue
- Missed opportunities and forgotten insights

### The Solution

VoiceTree frees your working memory and provides intuitive tree visualization of your entire thought process.

### How It Works

1. **Speak your thoughts** - Voice input is faster than typing and activates System 2 (deliberate) thinking
2. **Automatic tree construction** - Your speech becomes a structured tree within ~15 seconds
3. **Launch agents on nodes** - Each node can spawn an AI agent with its context
4. **Visual progress tracking** - See all your work and agent progress on one canvas

### Why Speaking Helps

Speaking your thoughts promotes clarity, reduces errors, and encourages deeper thinking by activating System 2 cognitive processing instead of automatic System 1 thinking.

### Context Preservation

The spatial tree structure preserves not just what you were thinking, but the entire context and reasoning path. Resuming work requires minimal cognitive load - the visual map instantly reconstructs your mental state.
