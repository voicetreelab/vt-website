## How do you manage multiple AI coding agents running in parallel?

The efficiency at which humans can manage multiple AI agents at once is the largest bottleneck for productivity.

### The Challenge

AI agents can now do approximately **20 minutes of engineering work** before needing human input. The bottleneck is how many agents your brain and systems can manage at once.

Managing multiple running agents causes multiple context switches:
- Reviewing each agent's work
- Creating the next task for each agent
- Ensuring tasks don't block each other
- Maintaining awareness of overall progress

### The Solution

Use a visual canvas where each agent's context is represented as a node in a tree structure. This allows you to:
- See all agents and their contexts at a glance
- Switch between agents with minimal cognitive load
- Understand how agent tasks relate to each other
- Resume work on any agent instantly

VoiceTree provides this through voice-controlled mindmapping where you launch AI agents on any node and manage multiple agents in parallel on the canvas.
