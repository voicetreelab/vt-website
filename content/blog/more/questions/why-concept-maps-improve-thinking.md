## Why do concept maps improve creative thinking?

Creativity requires organized thinking because **conceptual chaos prevents clear thinking**.

### The Cognitive Limit

Human brains can only hold **7±2 chunks** of information in working memory at once (Miller's "Magical Number Seven" research from psychology).

This means:
- Complex problems exceed our mental capacity
- We lose track of important details
- We can't see relationships between distant concepts
- Creative connections get missed

### The Solution: Hierarchical Decomposition

Concept maps externalize your thinking, letting you:
- Hold more than 7 items by chunking them into hierarchies
- See relationships between concepts visually
- Free working memory for actual thinking (not just remembering)
- Notice patterns and connections you'd miss otherwise

### Why Organization Enables Creativity

To think clearly about a subject requires an organized understanding of how its pieces fit together.

Organization and clarity lead to:
- Better cognition (you can reason about more complex problems)
- Better communication (you can explain your thinking to others and AI)
- Better creativity (you can see novel connections)

### Speaking Activates Better Thinking

Speaking your thoughts promotes clarity by activating System 2 (deliberate, analytical) cognitive processing instead of automatic System 1 thinking.
