VoiceTree ("we", "our", "us") is committed to being transparent about how we handle your data.

## What We Collect

**Usage Analytics**: We use PostHog to collect anonymous usage analytics, including features used, session duration, and general interaction patterns. This helps us understand how people use VoiceTree and where we can improve.

**Account Information**: If you create an account, we store your email address to communicate with you about the product.

**Voice and Content Data**: To provide our core features, your voice recordings are sent to third-party speech-to-text services for transcription, and your content may be processed by third-party AI services to generate and organize your mind maps. We may retain anonymized or aggregated data to improve our service.

## What We Don't Do

- We do not sell your data to third parties
- We do not use your data for advertising

## Third-Party Services

We use the following third-party services to operate VoiceTree:

- **Soniox** for speech-to-text transcription ([Soniox Privacy Policy](https://soniox.com/privacy))
- **Google Gemini** for AI processing ([Google Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy))
- **PostHog** for product analytics ([PostHog Privacy Policy](https://posthog.com/privacy))

These providers process data according to their own privacy policies. We recommend reviewing them if you have concerns.

## Data Retention

We currently do not store your voice recordings or mind map content on our servers beyond what is necessary to provide the service. This may change as we develop new features—we will update this policy and notify users of any significant changes.
