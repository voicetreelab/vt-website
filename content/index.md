## An Infinite Canvas for Orchestrating Coding Agents
### Effortlessly organise your ideas into a concept graph for flow-state context engineering 

Moving between thinking and doing is filled with painful context switches which kill your flow. We solve that by unifying thought and execution onto a single canvas. You architect, agents build.

### How does it work?

Voicetree extracts concepts and relationship from your speech or text to build a concept graph. You can launch a coding agent from any node, and it will be automatically given only the pruned, relevant context. Agents will document their progress by adding nodes back to the context-tree. 

This allows you to orchestrate over 6 agents at once. You can check their progress at a glance and if they start going off track, just keep speaking and it will notify the relevant agents. 

### Why?

The Voicetree canvas reduces the cost of context switching between thoughts, tasks and agents. Expensive thinking is automatically externalised and visually organised for you. This lowers the friction during problem-solving to enable a flow state.

- **You perform better:** 
	- No cold starts. Step away for a minute or a week. The tree will be exactly as you left it,  instantly reminding you of your most important thoughts, ready to be built upon further.
	- Navigate your thoughts spatially: Your brain is excellent at remembering where things are in space. We turn your projects into a map you can explore, where agents become landmarks, not just another terminal pane to cycle through. 

- **AI performs better**: pruning leads to an average of 60% fewer input tokens and more accurate responses. Your Claude code subscription will last longer, and be more valuable. 

- Together, collaborate at the speed of thought.
	- No more managing documentation, rewriting prompts, or painful context switches. 
	- Do it with your team: sync your graphs to work together, but async.

We are launching to a limited waitlist of 100 spots this December, 2025, secure your place by adding your email to the [google form](https://forms.gle/H4sWKnWqZNRjWNkp6) 

### For Developers

We are building Voicetree as a hackable platform for other developers to build on top of. Everything is stored on-device as markdown files. Agents are just your local terminal embedded in the canvas. Keep your same Claude settings and workflows, but make them even more powerful with Voicetree hooks.
