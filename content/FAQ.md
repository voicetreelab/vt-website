## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is Voicetree?

Voicetree is an infinite canvas for orchestrating coding agents. It helps developers organize ideas into a concept graph for flow-state context engineering. You architect your thoughts visually, and AI agents build based on that context.

### What is context engineering?

Context engineering is the practice of organizing and structuring information to provide AI models with precisely the right context they need. Voicetree automatically extracts concepts and relationships from your speech or text to build a context-tree that agents can navigate efficiently.

### Can I run multiple agents at once?

Yes. Voicetree allows you to orchestrate 6+ agents simultaneously. Each agent is visually positioned on the canvas, making it easy to track progress at a glance. If an agent starts going off track, you can speak corrections and Voicetree notifies the relevant agents.

### What makes Voicetree different from other AI coding tools?

Voicetree unifies thinking and execution onto a single canvas. Instead of context-switching between documentation, prompts, and terminal panes, you work in one spatial environment where thoughts become prompts and agents become landmarks you can navigate.

### Is my data stored on Voicetree servers?

Voicetree stores everything on-device as markdown files. Your Claude settings and workflows remain yours. Voice recordings are processed by third-party speech-to-text services but are not stored on our servers beyond what's necessary to provide the service.

### What platforms does Voicetree support?

Voicetree is available for macOS, Windows, and Linux.

### How do I get access to Voicetree?

Voicetree is currently in private alpha. You can [join the waitlist](https://forms.gle/H4sWKnWqZNRjWNkp6) to secure early access. We're launching to a limited waitlist of 100 spots in December 2025.

### Is Voicetree open source?

The Voicetree UI is open source and available on GitHub at [voicetreelab/voicetree-ui](https://github.com/voicetreelab/voicetree-ui). We're building Voicetree as a hackable platform for developers to build on top of.

### How can I contact the Voicetree team?
