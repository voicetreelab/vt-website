# fixups needed to our site!

1. make the blogs be orderer by priority in the explorer view on the website

   rank priority by the quality of eadch blogpost

2. The design of the sidebar doesn't distinguish between line wrapping for long blog titles vs a new blog itself, see if you can make this clear.


3. There's a ghost exploreer tree to     agent-canvas, see image. 

4. there's no large logo showing up. should have tree.png in the top left

Use subagents to help you.

  two fixups required

  top left large logo is too small, and it's background is white which doesn't match the offwhite backgroudn.  make largeer and match background


2. there's no root link for Home, which should be the landing page (An Infinite Canvas for Orchestrating Coding Agents)


3. there's a mysterious "Live Sessions" duplicate link at the root. The correct link I want to keep is in "blog/Voicetree Live Sessions", remove the empty "/Live-Sessions" page.

4. move blog > more to the bottom, it should be the last item, after all the initial blogs, not the first.

# font fixups

let's make font follow this:

   font = '"Fira Code", Fira Code, "Fira Mono", Menlo, Consolas, "DejaVu - Sans Mono", monospace';


althought titles might need to be different (titles should maybe be serif, perhaps Georgia, or idk what people recommend these days for design)

# look at the playwright test that produces image of the site


the navigation / explorer width is much too wide, it should be made much more compact, right now it takes up like a third of the page!

however it should still be readable when maximally expanded

# Siti: Website UI Fixes Complete
## Summary
Completed all 4 website fixes and deployed to Netlify.

## Changes Made

### 1. Blog Priority Sorting in Explorer
Added `priority` frontmatter to all blog posts (1-8, lower = higher quality):
1. 90% Token Reduction
2. From RAG to PAG
3. LLMs as Pattern Mappers
4. Complexity Threshold
5. Managing Multiple AI Agents
6. Functional Architecture for Agentic Frontend
7. History of Voicetree
8. Voicetree Live Sessions

Updated `quartz.layout.ts` with custom `explorerSortFn` to sort by priority.

### 2. Sidebar Line Wrapping Distinction
Modified `explorer.scss` to add:
- Margin between list items
- Block display with padding
- Subtle left border that shows on hover/active state

### 3. Ghost Explorer Removal
Deleted empty stub file `content/github.com/voicetreelab/agent-canvas.md`

### 4. Logo in Top Left
- Copied `tree.png` to `quartz/static/`
- Updated `PageTitle.tsx` to show 48x48 logo alongside title

## Files Changed

- quartz.layout.ts
- quartz/components/PageTitle.tsx

# Ren: Website UI Fixes Complete
## Summary
Completed 4 UI fixes for the VoiceTree website (Quartz-based):

1. **Logo size & background**: Increased logo from 48px to 64px, added transparent background
2. **Home link**: Added configurable Home link to Explorer navigation  
3. **Duplicate Live Sessions**: Staged deletion of root-level duplicate file
4. **Blog/more ordering**: Set priority: 999 to ensure it appears last

## Files Changed

- `quartz/components/PageTitle.tsx` - Logo sizing and background
- `quartz/components/Explorer.tsx` - Added homeLink option
- `quartz/components/scripts/explorer.inline.ts` - Home link implementation
- `quartz/components/styles/explorer.scss` - Home link styling
- `quartz.layout.ts` - Enabled homeLink in layout config
- `content/blog/more/index.md` - Added priority: 999
- `content/Live Sessions.md` - Deleted (staged)

## Key Diffs

### PageTitle.tsx
```css
.page-logo {
-  width: 48px;
-  height: 48px;
+  width: 64px;
+  height: 64px;
   object-fit: contain;
+  background: transparent;
}
```

### content/blog/more/index.md
```yaml
---
title: More
+priority: 999
---
```

# Otto: Explorer Width Reduced
## Summary
Reduced the explorer/navigation sidebar width from 320px to 220px to make it more compact while keeping text readable.

## DIFF
File changed: quartz/styles/variables.scss

```scss
- $sidePanelWidth: 320px; //380px;
+ $sidePanelWidth: 220px; // Reduced from 320px for more compact explorer
```

## Result
- Explorer now takes up ~30% less horizontal space
- Main content area has more room
- Navigation items remain readable (longer items like 'Frequently Asked Questions' wrap to 2 lines)
- Verified with Playwright test screenshot
